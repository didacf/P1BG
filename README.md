This is the first milestone project, for my SDSU Development program with ThriveDX
I am attempting to recreate the famous game Tetris with basic functionality.
Instructions:

Use the keyboard arrow keys, left to move left, Right to move Right, Down to go down and Up Arrow to rotate

Thanks to Ania Kubow so I learned and practice how to do this
